                            <p class = "card__title"> Cats: Joys of owning a cat </p>
                            <p class = "card__description"> Owning a cat can be an extremely rewarding relationship. A cat has the ability to both calm your nervous system and provide an immediate outlet for fun and play. <br> <br> 
                                Although cats are independent animals who like to scavenge and explore on their own terms, they are also very affectionate with their owners and people they trust. <br> <br> 
                                Most cats love to curl up in your lap at the end of a long day while you watch television or read a book. The simplicity of this act can cause an automatic release of all the right kinds of chemicals to your brain, allowing you to ease into the evening without the weight of the world on your shoulders. <br> <br>
                                Any cat owner will tell you just how much their furry friend helps them to relax and unwind. While many people enjoy the company of dogs, a cat can be more of an acquired taste—but once acquired, it’s a hard taste to lose. </p>

                            <p class = "card__description"> 
                                Dogs, often hailed as humans’ best friends, have been the topic of many scientific studies looking into how they might boost our well-being. <br> <br>
                                According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), an estimated 78 million dogs are owned as pets in the United States. <br> <br>
                                Just last year, Medical News Today reported on a study that showed that owning a dog reduces a person’s risk of premature death by up to a third. <br> <br>
                                Dogs can strengthen our health not just as we grow older, but also much, much earlier than that: before we are even born. </p>
